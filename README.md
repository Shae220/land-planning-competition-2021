# National Land Spatial Planning Competition (2021)
##  Overview
This project was developed as part of the 2021 National College Land Spatial Planning Skills Competition in China. Our team of five proposed a comprehensive spatial development plan for a rural village, based on GIS-driven analysis of land use, ecological priorities, and development potential.

##  Objective
To create a sustainable land-use plan by integrating spatial analysis, ecological evaluation, and visual design, with a focus on balancing development and conservation.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **GIS Software**: ArcGIS, QGIS
- **Programming**: Python (used for automated data processing)
- **Planning Tools**: Adobe Illustrator / PowerPoint (final presentation)
- **Analysis Models**: Land suitability evaluation, ecological zoning

##  My Role
- Collected and preprocessed spatial data including topography, land use, and infrastructure.
- Conducted land suitability analysis using multi-factor overlay methods.
- Designed visual maps for land-use zoning and ecological corridors.
- Proposed an "Ecology-First" zoning strategy to improve logical consistency in spatial models.
- Collaborated on a 35-page planning presentation and delivered the final pitch in competition.

##  Outcome
- Selected as one of the top 40 proposals out of 225 entries from 112 universities.
- Awarded **Third Prize ** at the national level.
- Strengthened my practical GIS skills and experience in interdisciplinary teamwork.

##  Preview
*Visual samples and planning maps will be uploaded after file transfer from local device.*

##  Files
This repository will be updated with design documents, planning visuals, and reference materials once they are retrieved.

##  Note
Due to the academic nature of the project, source data and materials will be uploaded in compliance with usage policies.
